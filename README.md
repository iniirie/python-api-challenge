Project Overview

This repository contains two Python projects that analyze and visualize weather data to assist in selecting ideal vacation spots.

Contents

1. WeatherPy

This notebook retrieves and analyzes weather data from various global cities using APIs. The data includes temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, which are visualized through scatter plots to identify patterns and relationships.

Results: The analysis helps in understanding how different weather factors correlate with each other across cities worldwide. For example, users can identify trends such as how temperature changes with latitude or how humidity impacts cloudiness.

2. VacationPy

Building on WeatherPy, this notebook filters cities based on ideal weather conditions. It then uses mapping techniques to visualize potential vacation destinations.

Results: The filtered data highlights cities that meet specific weather criteria, such as moderate temperatures and low humidity, ideal for vacationing. These locations are plotted on interactive maps, making it easy to visualize and select preferred destinations.
